# Waste Sorting Assistant: Offline AI for a Cleaner Planet 🤖♻️🌍

## Project Overview ✨

Welcome to the **Waste Sorting Assistant**!  
This project tackles the global challenge of waste management by providing an intelligent, AI-powered solution for accurate waste segregation.  

This innovative system leverages a powerful combination of mobile technology and a local AI inference engine. It's designed to provide instant sorting guidance, making eco-friendly disposal accessible wherever you are.

## Features 🚀

- **Offline AI Inference:** Real-time waste classification without an internet connection.
- **Image-Based Classification:** Snap a photo of a waste item for instant identification.
- **Dynamic Sorting Guidance:** Clear instructions and recommended bin colors (e.g., "Recyclable Plastic - Blue Bin").
- **Lightweight & Efficient:** Built with Flask and optimized TFLite models for minimal resource consumption.
- **Local Network Accessibility:** The Flask API can be accessed by mobile apps or other devices on your local network.
- **Future-Ready:** Designed for extensibility, enabling integration with advanced AI models like Google Gemma and robotic automation.

```

## Setup & Installation ⚙️

To get the Flask API running locally:

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+ (or compatible version for your TensorFlow installation)
- `pip` (Python package installer)

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/waste_sorting_flask.git
   cd waste_sorting_flask
   ```
   *(Replace `YourGitHubUsername` with your actual GitHub username)*

2. **Place your AI assets:**
   - Ensure your `model.tflite` and `labels.txt` files are in the `assets/` directory.
   - (Optional) Add `waste_guidelines.json` to `assets/` if available.

3. **Create and activate a virtual environment (Recommended!):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   # On Windows:
   .\venv\Scripts\activate
   # On macOS/Linux:
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

4. **Install Python dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   *Note: If you encounter issues with `tensorflow`, consider `pip install tflite_runtime` for a smaller, inference-only package, or ensure your `tensorflow` version matches your Python version.*

## Running the Application ▶️

To start the Flask API server:
```bash
python app.py
```
The server will typically start on `http://0.0.0.0:5000`.

- **Access from the same machine:**  
  `http://127.0.0.1:5000` or `http://localhost:5000`
- **Access from other local network devices:**  
  Use your computer's IP address (e.g., `http://192.168.1.X:5000`)

## API Endpoints 🔗

### `POST /predict`

This endpoint accepts an image and returns the predicted waste type, confidence, and sorting instructions.

- **URL:** `/predict`
- **Method:** `POST`
- **Content-Type:** `application/json`

**Request Body Example:**
```json
{
    "image": "base64_encoded_image_string_goes_here..."
}
```
- `image`: A base64 encoded string of the image data.

**Success Response (200 OK) Example:**
```json
{
    "predicted_label": "Plastic Bottle",
    "confidence": 0.9876,
    "category": "Recyclable Plastic",
    "instructions": "Rinse thoroughly and place in the blue recycling bin.",
    "bin_color": "blue"
}
```

**Error Response Example:**
```json
{
    "error": "Detailed error message explaining what went wrong."
}
```

## Offline Usage & Benefits 📶🚫

This application is designed for **complete offline operation**. Once the server is running on a local machine, it does not require an active internet connection to perform its core functions.

- **Fast:** No network latency to external cloud services.
- **Private:** Data stays on your local network.
- **Reliable:** Functions even during internet outages.

## The Future: Robots, Google Gemma, and Beyond! 🤖🌟

Our current Waste Sorting Assistant, while powerful, is just the beginning. The foundation built here with Flask and TFLite is perfectly positioned for exciting future developments:

- **Automated Sorting Robots:** Running this Flask API on embedded systems, guiding robotic arms in recycling facilities or smart home bins.
- **Google Gemma Integration:** Leveraging advanced models like **Google Gemma** (via Hugging Face) for multimodal capabilities:
  - **Deeper Contextual Understanding:** Beyond simple classification, Gemma could provide nuanced advice based on complex visual cues and external knowledge.
  - **Dynamic, Conversational Guidance:** Ask your smart bin for tailored, intelligent responses.
- **Continuous Learning:** Future iterations could incorporate feedback mechanisms to continuously improve the model's accuracy.

This project is a stepping stone towards a more sustainable and intelligently managed future for waste.

## Technical Highlights 💡

- **TensorFlow Lite:** Efficient on-CPU inference for edge deployment.
- **Precise Image Preprocessing:** Images are resized to 256x256 pixels for optimal model performance.
- **Flask-CORS:** Enabled for seamless cross-origin communication during development and testing.
